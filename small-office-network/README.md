# Small Office Network with Router-Based DHCP

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a small office network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Topology
- 1 Cisco router acting as default gateway and DHCP server
- 1 Layer-2 switch
- 3 end-user PCs

## Key Features
- Router-based DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
- Layer-2 switching for internal connectivity
- End-to-end connectivity validation using ping and ipconfig
- Observation of Spanning Tree behavior and PortFast configuration

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- TCP/IP, DHCP, ICMP

## Validation
- Verified DHCP lease assignment on endpoints
- Confirmed connectivity to default gateway and peer hosts
