# Networking Projects (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **hands-on networking labs** focused on practical, real-world networking concepts commonly used in enterprise IT environments.

The projects emphasize **Layer 2 and Layer 3 fundamentals**, including switching, routing, VLAN segmentation, and traffic verification. Each lab is designed to reinforce how data moves through a network and how configuration decisions affect connectivity.

---

## Repository Structure
Each project is organized into its own folder and includes:
- A fully configured Cisco Packet Tracer (`.pkt`) file  
- A labeled topology diagram or supporting screenshots  
- A project-specific `README.md` describing design, configuration, and validation

## Projects

### Enterprise Network Segmentation & Inter-VLAN Routing
**Technologies:** VLANs, 802.1Q Trunking, Layer 2 Switching, Layer 3 Routing  
**Folder:** `enterprise-network-segmentation`

An enterprise-style network design featuring multiple departmental VLANs isolated at Layer 2 and routed at Layer 3 using a router-on-a-stick architecture. Focuses on VLAN design, trunking, router subinterfaces, and traffic validation.

---

### Inter-VLAN Routing – Router-on-a-Stick
**Technologies:** VLANs, 802.1Q, Layer 2 Switching, Layer 3 Routing  
**Folder:** `vlan-inter-vlan-routing`

A focused lab demonstrating inter-VLAN routing using router subinterfaces. Highlights gateway configuration, VLAN connectivity, and Layer 2 vs Layer 3 behavior.

---

### Small Office Network Design with Router-Based DHCP
**Technologies:** DHCP, LAN Design, Switching, Basic Routing  
**Folder:** `small-office-network`

A small office LAN implementation using a router to provide centralized DHCP and default gateway services. Emphasizes IP addressing, access-layer configuration, and connectivity verification.

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- TCP/IP Networking  
- VLANs and 802.1Q Trunking  
- Inter-VLAN Routing  
- Network Diagnostics (ICMP, ARP)  

---

## Notes
These projects are intended to be reviewed both visually (via diagrams and screenshots) and interactively by opening the Packet Tracer files. All configurations follow standard enterprise networking practices and include verification steps.
