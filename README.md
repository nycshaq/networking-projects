Networking Projects (Cisco Packet Tracer)
Overview

This repository contains a collection of hands-on networking labs focused on practical, real-world networking concepts commonly used in enterprise IT environments.

The projects emphasize Layer 2 and Layer 3 networking fundamentals, including switching, routing, VLAN segmentation, and traffic verification. All labs are designed to reinforce understanding of how data moves through a network and how configuration decisions impact connectivity.

Each project is fully documented and includes configuration artifacts and validation steps.

Repository Structure

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes:

A fully configured Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) file

A labeled topology diagram or supporting screenshots

A project-specific README.md detailing design, configuration, and testing

Projects
🔹 Enterprise Network Segmentation & Inter-VLAN Routing

Technologies: VLANs, 802.1Q Trunking, Layer 2 Switching, Layer 3 Routing
📁 Folder: enterprise-network-segmentation

An enterprise-style network design featuring multiple departmental VLANs isolated at Layer 2 and routed at Layer 3 using a router-on-a-stick architecture. Focuses on VLAN design, trunking, router subinterfaces, and traffic validation.

🔹 Inter-VLAN Routing – Router-on-a-Stick

Technologies: VLANs, 802.1Q, Layer 2 Switching, Layer 3 Routing
📁 Folder: vlan-inter-vlan-routing

A focused lab demonstrating inter-VLAN routing using router subinterfaces. Highlights gateway configuration, VLAN connectivity, and Layer 2 vs Layer 3 behavior.

🔹 Small Office Network Design with Router-Based DHCP

Technologies: DHCP, LAN Design, Switching, Basic Routing
📁 Folder: small-office-network

A small office LAN implementation using a router to provide centralized DHCP and default gateway services. Emphasizes IP addressing, access-layer configuration, and connectivity verification.

Tools & Technologies

Cisco Packet Tracer

TCP/IP Networking

VLANs and 802.1Q Trunking

Inter-VLAN Routing

Network Diagnostics (ICMP, ARP)

Notes

These projects are intended to be reviewed both visually (via diagrams and screenshots) and interactively by opening the Packet Tracer files. All configurations follow standard enterprise networking practices and are documented to reflect real troubleshooting and validation workflows.
